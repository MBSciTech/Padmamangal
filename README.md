**Tech Stack Suggestion (Simple & Fast)**

* **Frontend**: React (with TailwindCSS or Chakra UI for styling)
* **Backend**: Node.js + Express (or Firebase if you want quick setup)
* **Database**: MongoDB (if Node backend) or Firestore (if Firebase)
* **Auth**: Google Sign-In / Email-Password login
* **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend) + Render/Firebase (backend)

If you want, I can make you a **modular development plan** so you can start with 2–3 features and add more over time. That way you’ll have a working version quickly.
